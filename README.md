Project Overview
This repository showcases my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance through two significant projects completed during my course. The first project focuses on implementing and testing a contact service, while the second project involves summarizing and reflecting on various approaches to software testing and design. These projects demonstrate my ability to create effective unit tests, analyze software requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet those requirements.

Submitted Files
Project One: Contact Service
Contact.java: Defines the Contact class, which includes attributes like contact ID, first name, last name, phone number, and address.
ContactService.java: Manages a list of contacts, providing functionality to add, update, and delete contacts while ensuring the integrity of the data.
ContactTest.java: Contains unit tests for the Contact class to verify the correct implementation of its attributes and methods.
ContactServiceTest.java: Includes unit tests for the ContactService class, ensuring that the add, update, and delete functionalities work as expected.

Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
Summary_and_Reflections_Report.pdf: A detailed report summarizing the approaches taken in Project One and reflecting on the overall learning experience, including the methods used for software testing and design.

Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring that my code is functional and secure is a priority in all stages of software development. 
I implement rigorous unit testing, as seen in my ContactServiceTest.java, where each method is tested under various conditions to ensure that it performs as expected. 
Security is also a key consideration. I adhere to best practices such as input validation, secure error handling, and avoiding the use of hard-coded credentials. 
This approach not only protects the software from potential vulnerabilities but also ensures that it remains functional and reliable over time.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs requires clear communication and thorough analysis of the requirements. 
During the initial stages of development, I work closely with stakeholders to gather and understand their needs. 
These requirements are then translated into actionable specifications, which guide the development process. 
In the ContactService.java, for example, I implemented functionalities that directly address the user’s needs, such as the ability to add, update, and delete contacts. 
By continuously referring to the original requirements throughout the development process, I ensure that the final product meets or exceeds user expectations.

How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design is systematic and user-centric. I begin by outlining the software architecture, taking into consideration factors such as scalability, maintainability, and performance. 
I emphasize modular design, breaking down the software into smaller, manageable components that can be independently developed and tested. 
This not only makes the development process more efficient but also enhances the overall quality of the software. 
Throughout the design phase, I remain focused on the user’s needs, ensuring that the software is intuitive and meets the intended purpose. 
The result is a thorough and user-friendly program that is both functional and adaptable to future needs.
